Tony has been referred to a social worker by his medical provider who is concerned about symptoms of depression and anxiety that Tony reported in his physical exam.
Do you have a sense of why you're here?
Yeah, my doctor sent me.
So I'd like to ask you some questions about how you're feeling. How has your mood been lately?
Um, I don't really know what you mean.
Have you been feeling sad or depressed?
Not really.
Have you been crying a lot?
I don't really cry.
Have you been feeling hopeless?
How about feeling edgy or angry?
Well, yeah, I guess I feel angry sometimes. Kind of like I just want to fight someone.
We can definitely talk more about that.
Do you ever feel like you don't have much energy or like you're not very interested in things?
Well, I like basketball, but sometimes I don't even have enough energy to play. I don't like school.
How are you doing in school?
Well, I used to get all A's and B's, but my grades are kind of going down. That's mainly just because I don't do my homework anymore.
Why not?
I don't like it. It's even hard getting up in the mornings.
Do you use drugs or alcohol?
I guess I'll have a beer or two with my friends sometimes.
It sounds like things are not always going so great. You like playing basketball, but sometimes you have trouble getting up in the morning and getting interested in school.
And you can sometimes get pretty angry. How long have you been feeling that way?
For like two months since me and my girlfriend broke up. It makes me really angry with her or just with anyone.
When I think about it, I get a tight pain in my chest and my heart beats really fast. I don't even know why she did break up with me, but it hurts. I don't even want to be alive.
Have you had thoughts about doing something to hurt yourself?
Yeah.
Tell me more about that.
