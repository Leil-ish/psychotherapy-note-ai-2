## Evaluation of Generated Note (Risk Assessment Vignette - Using Prompt v2)

This evaluation assesses the clinical note generated from the suicide risk assessment vignette transcript using the refined prompt (`prompt_v2.txt`).

### 1. Clinical Accuracy

* **Reflects Transcript Details:** **Met.** The note accurately reflects the key details presented in the short vignette, including the reason for referral, the client's reported symptoms (anger, low energy, declining grades), the recent breakup, the specific disclosure of suicidal ideation ("I don't even want to be alive"), and the denial of sadness.
* **Hallucinations/Unsupported Interpretations:** **Met.**
    * **Visual Hallucinations:** Successfully avoided. The note correctly states "Visuals not available from transcript" for Appearance and omits other unsupportable visual details, adhering to the refined prompt's constraints.
    * **Interpretations:** Clinical interpretations (e.g., potential MDD/Anxiety needing further assessment, impaired judgment due to SI, limited insight) are present in the Assessment and MSE but are appropriately qualified and directly linked to the high-risk information presented (SI). They appear clinically reasonable given the context.
* **Tone & Detail:** **Met.** The tone is appropriately professional, objective, and conveys the seriousness of the risk disclosure without being alarmist. The level of detail is suitable for a clinical note based on the vignette's content.

### 2. Completeness

* **Sections Present:** **Met.** All requested primary sections (SOAP, MSE, Risk Assessment) and their relevant sub-sections are present.
* **Appropriately Addressed:** **Met.** Each section contains information pertinent to its heading, drawn directly from the vignette. The note appropriately indicates where information was not available or not assessed within the short interaction (e.g., HI, specific self-harm behaviors, perception, cognition, protective factors).

### 3. Clinical Relevance/Salience

* **Captures Significant Information:** **Met.** The note correctly identifies and prioritizes the most clinically significant information â€“ the client's suicidal ideation. Other relevant details (triggering event, associated symptoms) are included appropriately.
* **Highlights Safety Details:** **Met.** The Risk Assessment section is clear, accurate, and effectively highlights the critical safety concern (SI present, high-risk level assigned). It appropriately notes the need for immediate further assessment (lethality, intent, means) and safety planning, making this crucial information highly accessible.

### Evaluation Summary (Risk Assessment Vignette Note)

The refined prompt (`prompt_v2.txt`) performed excellently when applied to the risk assessment vignette. It generated a note that was accurate, complete, clinically relevant, and free from the visual hallucinations present in the initial output from the first transcript. Most importantly, it accurately captured and appropriately highlighted the critical risk information (suicidal ideation), populating the Risk Assessment section in a clinically sound manner based *only* on the provided transcript. This demonstrates the refined prompt's improved accuracy and its ability to handle focused, high-risk clinical content effectively.
