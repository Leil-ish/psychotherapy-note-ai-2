**1. SOAP Note**

**S (Subjective):**  The client, Tony, reported being referred by his medical doctor due to concerns about depression and anxiety. 
He initially denied feeling sad or depressed and stated he doesn't cry. However, he acknowledged experiencing anger, stating he feels 
like "fighting someone," and a lack of energy impacting his enjoyment of basketball and his school performance (grades declining due 
to lack of homework completion). He reported these feelings have lasted for approximately two months, coinciding with a recent breakup 
with his girlfriend.  He described experiencing physical symptoms associated with his emotional state, including chest tightness and a 
rapid heartbeat when thinking about the breakup. He admitted to having thoughts of self-harm.

**O (Objective):** The client's affect, as derived from the transcript, is described as primarily irritable and potentially dysphoric 
(based on statements regarding anger and self-harm ideation).  He reported physical symptoms of chest tightness and rapid heartbeat. 
He expressed that he "doesn't really cry" and denied feeling hopeless or depressed, although these denials warrant further assessment. 
While he reported occasional alcohol use ("a beer or two"), details about quantity and frequency were not provided.  He reported 
decreased academic performance related to decreased motivation.  He disclosed suicidal ideation.

**A (Assessment):** Based solely on the transcript, the client presents with symptoms consistent with a potential diagnosis of 
Major Depressive Disorder, possibly with associated anxiety. Further assessment is necessary to rule out other diagnoses.  His 
recent relationship breakup appears to be a significant contributing factor to his current distress. The disclosure of suicidal 
ideation warrants immediate attention and thorough risk assessment. The client's presentation displays symptoms that are consistent
with the initial concern of depression and anxiety.  His affect and behavior are concerning based on his admission to suicidal 
ideation.

**P (Plan):**  A comprehensive assessment of current symptoms and history is needed. This includes a detailed exploration of suicidal 
ideation, including assessment of lethality, intent, and means.  A safety plan should be collaboratively developed and implemented. 
Further assessment of potential diagnoses, including Major Depressive Disorder and Anxiety Disorders, is warranted. Exploring the 
client's relationship history and coping mechanisms is indicated. Collaboration with the referring physician is recommended to 
coordinate care and address any potential somatic symptoms.  Follow-up sessions should be scheduled to monitor progress, evaluate
the effectiveness of interventions, and address any emerging concerns.  Referral to a psychiatrist for medication evaluation may be 
considered.


**2. Mental Status Examination (MSE)**

* **Appearance:** Visuals not available from transcript.
* **Behavior/Psychomotor Activity:**  Client's psychomotor activity is not explicitly described, but his statement that it's hard 
to get up in the mornings suggests potential lethargy or decreased energy.
* **Attitude Toward Interviewer:** Cooperative, although initially guarded in his initial responses to questions about mood.
* **Mood:**  Reported as angry.  Subjective reporting of mood may be unreliable, based on his initial denials of sadness.
* **Affect:** Irritable, constricted (limited range of emotion initially).  Potentially dysphoric (based on self-harm ideation).  
Reactivity to discussion of breakup is significant.
* **Speech:** Rate, volume, and clarity are not specified in the transcript.
* **Thought Process:** Linear, goal-directed in response to direct questioning.
* **Thought Content:**  Preoccupation with his recent breakup; suicidal ideation present.  "I don't even want to be alive."
* **Perception:** No hallucinations reported.
* **Cognition:** Not assessed in this session.
* **Insight:**  Limited insight into the severity of his symptoms; minimized initial distress.
* **Judgment:** Impaired judgment regarding his safety given the disclosure of suicidal ideation.


**3. Risk Assessment**

* **Suicidal Ideation (SI):** Present.  The client explicitly stated, "I don't even want to be alive."  Further assessment of 
lethality, intent, and means is urgently required.
* **Homicidal Ideation (HI):** Not indicated in transcript.
* **Self-Harm Behavior:** Not indicated in transcript, although suicidal ideation is present.
* **Other Risk Factors:**  Recent relationship breakup; anger; decreased energy; decreased school performance; alcohol use 
(occasional).
* **Protective Factors:**  Not explicitly identified in this transcript.
* **Overall Risk Level:** High.  Suicidal ideation necessitates immediate intervention.
* **Safety Plan Notes:** A safety plan was not developed in this session but is urgently needed.
* **Note if therapist made recommendations for higher level of care, means restriction, or other explicit safety measures:**  
Based on the client's disclosure of suicidal ideation, immediate assessment for higher levels of care and/or means restriction 
should be considered.  The therapist should assess for potential need for hospitalization.
