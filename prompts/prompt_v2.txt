--- TRANSCRIPT START ---

Annabeth, nice to see you again today. It's nice to see you too. You know this
week I was reviewing our notes from last week just to remind me what we had
covered. We talked a lot in terms of mental performance about your focus, how
you are moving from nutritionist to physical therapist to coaching to your
counseling appointments as you're sort of preparing yourself to get back on
the tour. And one thing I noticed that was absent from those notes is that I
don't think I ever really asked you how you feel about returning to bowling,
returning to the professional tour. I'm having a lot of feelings about it and a
lot of them are surprising to me and I'm not having an easy time getting
through those feelings. You feel like you can share with me some of what those
feelings are? You know I think my husband and my kids blame me being on tour for
getting so sick and so the thought of going back on tour I think scares them
a little bit. Also I've got some guilt around it and I don't know what to do
if I'm not on tour anymore. I don't know who that person is. Wow I just heard a
ton in your statement. Family is grumpy with you. Kids and husband which are
sort of like two different types of guilt, right? Yeah. I heard some fear of
not knowing what you would do if you didn't return to tour and I'm still
wondering if you also feel a little concerned that you delayed access to
care because you were on tour? Am I hearing all those things correctly? Yeah
I am. As much as I don't want to go there I'm asking myself that question you
know would I have gotten so incredibly ill if I had taken care of myself sooner?
Super honest question isn't it? Yeah it's hard. Yeah raw. I remember in your intake you told me that your
mother died of breast cancer at a fairly young age. 47. Wow right at the time
where you're a mom having children, need your mom, how does that play into this
rawness about whether or not you pursued care at the right time? Well I mean I
know that it was not something I wanted to focus on. I wanted to move
past it. I wanted to show my kids you know people do die and you can move on
and you can still have a life and you can do stuff and be effective you know
but on the other end of it I think I just didn't want to think about that
possibility. I hear the mom part coming out. I've got kids that knew their
grandmother my job is to help them move through this grief. I wonder if you ever
moved through that grief? No I think I just put it on hold and I just started
focusing on my job. Sometimes I don't know if this is true for you but
sometimes what happens is when we put grief on hold everything surrounding
that issue it also gets put on hold. So I'm thinking about you know the nitty
gritty. Do you avoid doing breast self exams because mom died of breast cancer?
Do you avoid going to the doctor regularly because mom died of breast
cancer? It's not just the grieving that we sometimes put on hold it's everything
around a topic. Is that true for you or is it more just the grief? I lied when I
went to the doctor and I said that I did breast exams. I've never done a breast
exam on myself. Never. Embarrassed to say. And yet you're saying it to me now. Why?
Well I mean I feel like I trust you that I can say things that are hard to
say to you because we've worked together you know. Thank you for that by the way.
Yeah but I also I'm also just this really hard place in my life and I
know that the way that I've done things all along kind of needs to shift in some
way so I don't get sick again or you know what I mean? Yeah. And I don't know
what that looks like. It's scary. I don't want to put words in your mouth so
remember you're always the final say on your experience in life. You didn't just
have breast cancer you had stage four. I mean from what you were telling me you
went through chemo, radiation, multiple times through that. You have had your
breasts removed. You've gone through all the scarring that that created and the
treatment for that. You've then had implants and all of the while battling
to stay alive. Really battling to stay alive. So I wonder if this reimagining of
your life is so scary because you know the alternative. Like are you living
your best self? Are you living your best life? Because now you know what the
alternative looks like. The stakes are really high.
Tell me about those stakes. What's gonna happen if you actually reimagined your
life? Well I mean the way my marriage has always worked is that I go out and go
on tour and he takes care of everything. He takes care of the kids. He takes care of
the house. He takes care of paying the bills. He takes care of everything and
then when we when I get home we're really happy to see each other you know
and I don't know what happens to my marriage if I'm at home all the time. Is
he gonna want me to be around all the time? Is that the fear that exists just
because it's a change in a pattern of behavior or have you seen signs that
this could be an issue for in real life? Well he's just said to me many times and
so I love our marriage. It works so well for our family and you know I love
missing you because I get to be so happy when you're home and and they've been
through so much with this illness you know and I I just don't know what if my
husband's gonna feel real crowded or if he's still gonna if he's still gonna
want me the way he has. I heard you as you were describing his comments about
the life you had prior to the illness. This little caveat and I don't know if
it was his in his voice or yours that there was something about this quality
of you being gone and then coming back that really matters. I internally had a
little sense of fear like oh gosh what does that actually mean? Am I reading
that off you? Yeah. Tell me about that. There's almost like an instinct that you
know is under there that you're not quite saying. I guess you know my body is
different. Everything's different and that's been challenging enough for like
my husband to see me undress or anything like that's been hard enough. Because you
had to go a long time as well with the mastectomy before they did the breast
implants. That and then the scarring was horrific and you know the radiation
gives you burns all over. I mean it was horrible. You're a different person
physically. Yeah yeah so there's that and I feel like we're we're still working on
overcoming that you know I am anyway. He says he loves me no matter what and I
believe him but at the same time I am really aware of that in my body. You know
that your body is different so you it's hard to accept that somebody else
doesn't see it as vastly different. Yeah. Gotcha. Or doesn't have that mental
image of when it was so horrible you know when I was just my skin was burned
basically and you know. Because you had the felt sense of it. He just had the
visual of it. Yeah yeah so anyway there's that part that you know we have to work
through and and I'm thinking like okay well that's hard enough. If we change
everything about excuse me if we change everything about the way our marriage
has functioned is our marriage going to function? Does that make sense? It makes
absolute sense and I think it's very thoughtful. It's it's very challenging
and I see the emotion that is connected with it and I think we could delve into
17 different parts of that but I have to say to you the fact that you're doing
this questioning now is very brave because it would be as exhausted as you
are. I still think it would be easier to fall into your old patterns. Work with
the coach. Go to the nutritionist. Get your energy back. Develop that arm
strength again. You could do all of that. Yeah I can. But that's not why you're in
the chair. Like I think you're in the chair because you're trying to figure
out is this really what you want and if in fact you have to acknowledge that it
might not be you then risk everything that you look at the emotion that pops
up when I say that. Take a breath. What about what I just said had that impact
on you? I think it's just really can I take a clean? Absolutely. I think it's
just really you know if you keep moving forward it's like the grief with my mom
you know I don't have to go there but when I think about stopping in my tracks
and like everything behind you suddenly catches up like you fast-braked in a
car and all the groceries come flying forward. Yeah that's a great analogy
because that's what it feels like and then I don't have any control you know
and I I've had some little control with all the treatments and everything you
know how I feel and that's really hard because you know I'm I'm an athlete I
know the harder you work the better you get it gives you more control. I can do
something to improve this motion this behavior this outcome. Yeah but I can
adjust and I get a different result you know. Not what's interesting is not only
would you have very little control but you'd also be forced not to act when
you're too sick to do anything but vomit hard to make yourself feel better when
your skin is burning and you don't want to be touched and you're trying to lay
in a bed and not have the covers hit you look at that so you have time to not
just the lack of control but then time to ponder. That's exactly what's
going on is this is the first time in years maybe ever that I have all this
time on my hands and I don't like it and it's not comfortable. What does it feel
like to hear me say that what you're describing really does sound very hard? I
mean it feels validating and sad it's it's much easier for me as an athlete to
just say buck up walk it off you know kind of yeah so. Look at what you're
doing right now right in the moment you're trying to compare and utilize the
skill sets that you use for 20 plus years on the tour that helped you be
super successful and apply them to a reimagined life because you don't have
much like guidelines there's no margin you can't quite figure out what that
looks like. Well I've been following the same map my whole life I don't have
another map I don't know I don't know I don't know anything anymore. We clearly
know that you love and are committed to your husband and your marriage we
clearly know that you love your children but let's imagine for a second
that they didn't have an opinion that we absolutely knew that whatever decision
you made they were going to be there in support of you. Okay. So that we can sort
of take them off the table just for a little bit. Okay. Then what what happens
for you emotionally about where you're at? You mean if I'm just thinking about
what you might want to do with your life? I think I would I wish I could
give myself the space to think about that more. I'm sorry that's not a great
answer but I've never had that much I've never given myself room to to think
that way. I love that answer and by the way it doesn't matter if an answer is
greater is not great right? But what I love about that answer is it it seemed
very honest meaning I don't even know how to do that is what you're telling me.
I don't. I have no idea what it means to set aside my responsibilities to my
husband and my children and our finances and our home and actually just focus
right here on what this person in the chair wants. Yeah because even when I was
really sick my my job was to get better. So it was always you know just
to get better. Yeah and I'm thinking back to our very first intake session when I
was asking you about the history with your own family your parents and you
described this amazing bond with your dad because he was you guys were bowling
buddies right? He was the guy who coached you from very little look at that
beautiful smile but I'm gonna push you a little bit here. Okay. I believe that you
can have a great relationship with your dad but I wonder if he didn't set you up
a little bit for a very early focus even in your youth on goal orientation
rather than I want to say whole person development because he saw your skill
set and wanted to help you become that bowler that you seemed passionate to be
and yet from a very early age I think you told me 10 or 11 you guys started
talking about pro bowling. Is it hard to hear that? Yeah I feel myself getting a
little mad because I love my dad and I and I know that he he did what he did
so that I could have a career and a life that was not just you know hear
your choices become a teacher or go to nursing school you know my dad wanted me
to imagine a life that was what I what I wanted what I was good at. Yeah. So I feel
myself feeling defensive. Yeah you get to I mean and you get to always remember
tell me if you think I'm off. I just started listening to your goal oriented
language and thought would that goal oriented language be so embedded in you
is that a natural personality thing or is that just you've been working on a
specific goal for lots longer than you know most people have in their life. I
don't think I know the answer. I mean maybe it's both I'm not I'm not really
sure it's just when I think back as a kid that that's all I remember is I've
just been very driven and if you want something go after it work hard get it
you know so that's just I don't know how much of that. I have an idea yeah name
another thing in life that you're so goal driven about other than bowling.
Well putting putting away money for the college for a kid for the kids. Financial
management for your family. Yeah okay you know making sure that they had
everything they needed you know making sure that you know everybody was
comfortable. Yeah you know so finances for your family yeah bowling which
provides the finances for the family and that you love don't want to just demean
that in a sense. What about just you? Something really goal-driven oriented
passionate just related to the person of Rita. Hmm fitness but again that's also
got to do with my job. Does it? I mean I want to give you the leeway to really
explore that. Yes fitness relates to your to your work bowling do you think you
would have a passion for fitness if that's not what you chose to do for
living in the future? Yeah I think I would I think that I like feeling strong
and that was something I really missed when I got sick you know and so I've
always realized when I got so ill that I've always been a woman who's felt very
physically you know strong I can I can pick this up I can do this you know.
Sense of security and autonomy. Autonomy yeah yeah okay and so when I got so sick
I lost that so now that I'm starting to rebuild that again yeah I realize how
important it is to me. I'm not sure if I answered your question. You did and I'm gonna sort of
pull us out of the moment purposefully foot for a second okay I don't know if
you just realized what you did but you told me something about just you and
your value without referencing the kids without referencing your husband and
without relating it to bowling you just told me something that you would be
passionate about as an individual. Okay I guess I did. What is look at the smile
what does that mean to you? Well it feels good it feels good to know that that I'm
important to me too the things that I want and it's not just about taking care
of everybody else. You could find a piece one piece of a person that is just you
just about you yeah and it didn't you didn't cry you didn't cry it's not bad
but nothing horrible happened yeah yeah you're I can see the smile you're
getting what I'm saying even though I'm not really saying it well. No I think you
are I mean I yeah that's like a first step isn't it like a baby step about
what do I want for me yeah. So how do you know now that you know at least with
this one tiny example that you can do this you can flesh out the who of who
you are yeah tell me about the very real situations with your husband your
children that make you have this concern that they might not be able to accept a
new version of you. The concern comes from the fact that when I was so sick
and they were so supportive but you know it kills me that they saw me in such a
weak and sick state when I've always been this rock for the family yeah and
it was the look on their face they were so scared of it it makes me feel like I
don't want to I don't want them to worry about me feeling weak again like I don't
do you know what I mean I don't want them being like oh my god is mom okay
you know oh my god is my wife gonna be all right I that was just horrible the
whole time I was sick. Was it horrible for you? Yeah. No I mean watching your
mom be sick. Oh yeah. Did you watch her be sick or were you on tour? I was not
around for a lot of it she also hit a lot of it you know she's um I mean she
was very stubborn lady and I get that from her so she I didn't I didn't know
she was sick until she was very very sick. Until she was already close to
passing yeah yeah yeah and so when you're then the one who's sick and
you're watching your children watch you is your concern about how your children
would deal with it if you passed away or were you sort of stuck in that moment
of losing your own mom? I really didn't think about my mom that much to be honest
with you I I just saw the look on my husband and my kids faces and knew how
scared they were that they were gonna lose me and that's really where my
focus was that's kind of what got me up every day and fought fighting. So this
interesting the fact is that if you go back on tour that connection gets
disrupted a little bit yeah yeah look at that there was a little bit of a nervous
smile there yeah it does tell me about that well things are never gonna be the
same and the part of me knows that gets it things are forever changed and that
is not necessarily bad but if I could get some semblance of my life back I
think it would create sort of a comfort I don't know a comfort level that that
has been gone for the last couple years. I'm almost hearing that you want some
normalcy some pattern to sort of bring the previous types of interactions
back to the forefront rather than having them still look at you like are you okay
today is that happening a lot where they're like mom are you okay because
they you were so sick yeah they're like mom let me get that actually let me get
it yeah you know what is there any advantage from your perspective to your
children having seen you through this illness any advantage yeah for them yes
I think that they see that bad things can happen and our family's strong and
our family is just supportive and loving and that if you have that foundation you
know you'll get through it mm-hmm did you sense some like unconditional love
oh gosh yeah yeah so you because you've consistently described these really
great kids is what I'm getting at so I'm trying to understand that connection
that you're drawing in your heart and mind between potentially letting go of
their old version of mom and designing a new one I'm hearing you know that they
unconditionally love and accept you but I'm afraid of what will happen with them
if I don't go back to the standard person I am yeah so what is that you
can group you get it what is that incongruency about I don't know it's
just change you know they've been through so much change the whole time I
was sick it's just you know you always want to protect your kids and keep them
they're grown-ups but it's just that that change you know have you had
conversations with any of your kids about your feelings about the changing
and all that's changing and their experience of you being sick no why not
I don't know how to I don't know how to bring it up I feel really weird you know
what do I just did dinner so you guys you know let's talk about what I was
really sick so I just don't know I don't know how to do it can I push again can I
have your permission to push again okay seems to me that you hold a lot in your
own head almost like you're having conversations with all of these people
about all of these things but just in here because the unknown is so worrisome
to you that you just don't engage you don't play the game right you don't get
out there and allow them to have their part in their relationship because
you're making the decision about what conversation they can manage and can't
what amount of change they can manage and can't and yet I hear you telling me
they're great kids they've all gone through college they're all living
independently you've got a couple that are starting families and they have seen
really hard times they have potentially faced the loss of their mom why can't
they have these conversations I mean it just feels really uncomfortable and I
don't know exactly I mean you know maybe I just need to say look we need to have
a family meeting and just all sit down and go to the beach for a day and just
talk about all the things mm-hmm does that feel like wow at least if I did it
all together in one fell swoop this conversation would be over with and I
can move on I don't know if it would be over that but it would um I think it'd
be nice for us all to be together to know that you know somebody says
something it's okay you know you're not playing the telephone game we were one
game yeah yeah yeah when you imagine doing something like that inviting your
kids off to the beach and having some family time and then bringing up this
sort of sad and scary and interesting topic what happens for you hmm I don't
know in some ways that sounds kind of great hmm what ways sound great well we
could all be together we'll be at the beach is beautiful you know we can all
make food together hang out together there'll be no pressure of everyday life
sort of getting in the way you know phone calls no emails get away from the
standard ways that life imposes yeah yeah do you think you'd have to have a
conversation an authentic and honest conversation with your husband before
this family event yeah I would what would that be like I have to tell him my
concerns I have to ask him hard questions and I have to be ready for
whatever he says let's imagine that what he has to say you don't want to hear
don't believe me I've already imagined that a hundred that I know that that's
why you stay stuck in your head right it's sort of why you're here is let's
get it out of your head sometimes just sharing it with another person allows
you to really a own it and be here the things that probably aren't true okay so
tell me what you think the conversations gonna go like between you and your
husband I'm my biggest concern is that if I say honey I just I don't think I
want to tour anymore after this one I think you know I've worked so hard to
get ready for this one like you know what might as well do it but but I think
we need to make some different plans for the future my concern is that he's
gonna say absolutely yes whatever you need but that that he might not feel
like he can be honest with me because he needs to support me you know what I
mean so in essence you're talking about a really nice guy who's gonna give up
the dreams he's had for your family because you've just come off of an
illness he wants to be the concern and caring husband is he really that
inauthentic no but I think there's absolutely an element of wanting to make
me feel safe and and secure you know and and I he does you know he is the kind of
person that kind of will give up of himself you know he's been the caregiver
and the nurture in your family all his role so my worry is that he he might do
that in an effort to take care of me instead of just saying what he feels to
take care of himself and if he didn't if he actually was honest with you and said
I'm a little nervous too I am going to be supportive of you but I'm also
concerned that this dynamic that we have of having excitement about seeing each
other is going to be gone and you're right this whole year is I guess would
be more than a year now almost two years of your treatment has been super hard
and I'm I was desperately looking forward to you leaving and getting back
into that old dynamic what would happen for you if you said something like that
I don't know I really don't I mean I I think I I would be glad to know the
truth if that was what was true for him you know it's just the fear of it is
bigger than actually probably doing it you know what I mean I sort of know what
you mean so in this case I want to know what the actual doing it part means for
you it's just gonna I'm afraid that that if he says that that our marriage could
get into trouble I thought you're gonna say something else this is super
interesting I thought you were gonna say that if in fact he really said that you
would just buck up and go back on tour permanently well ultimately that's
probably what I would do so that was a fair sort of yeah I mean I think I think
that fear would get there and then I you know I'd be really worried about my
marriage and then I think if I know myself I would just go like okay well
let's just not rock this I don't want to mess with this okay so let me pull the
pieces together okay and I'm sorry for the convoluted way I'm in which I'm
gonna do this okay we've just had early in this conversation this important
dialogue about how meaningful it would be for you to find yourself yes after
this is very significant what we would call a non normative life and then you
almost died mm-hmm the meaningfulness about knowing who you are and what you
want and the recognition that wow that can change right in the middle of a life
it can change and that seems both scary and absolutely valuable you have to do
that now something is different in your life and what you just told me is if
your husband told you the truth you'd hide that away again and tell him what
he needed to hear and do what you needed to do do you really believe you could
stuff that part of yourself away I have to think about that it's pretty big
isn't it yeah it's really big I I have to think about that from the person
sitting back here from the counselor's chair you know I only work with this
person I respect your family they certainly have been there for you I've
never met them but I respect the way you talk about them and I believe how you
talk about them but you're the person in the chair and as a clinician I go oh my
gosh how is she going to live the rest of her life not being true not just to
who she is but the entirety of her life experience and I think while that would
be the saddest day is the day that you realize that despite the significant
lesson in your life you had to go back to doing everything you previously did
as though nothing had changed I hear you I hear what you're saying that seems
really sad does when you say it like that I feel like maybe this is something
I need to mull over yeah take and take you should take the time to do that
right nothing is going to happen if you don't rush out to have these
conversations right away but just being able to take the time to engage here it
feels like it gives you an alternative like someplace to truly talk about what
it is you want what you believe what you value that's very true and I want you to
know that there's not a right answer if you said to me this is what's best for
the entirety of my life and I'm going back on tour and that's just going to be
the way it is my heart would be for you yeah not against you I know you know I
just want to help you focus on what it is that is most important to you I get
it and I guess I have to do a lot more thinking you're welcome to it make sure
you get enough sleep oh right yeah all right it's gonna exhaust you yeah to do
all of this thinking you know maybe what I need to do is get is to keep a
diary when I was a kid maybe something like that you know if I can just jot
these things down when they pop into my head yeah it's a fabulous idea I love
that you came up with that all on that when I was a kid I had one in it and I
kind of really I forgot all about that but I it was really kind of cool to have
that that little relationship with myself yes you know yeah especially when
you're not sure like you're testing the waters and you're not quite sure you
fully believe that part of yourself yet yeah that self is strong enough to
really advocate yeah that that journal sounds like a live thing I'm gonna go
buy one today awesome that's phenomenal I love it when clients come up with their
own homework I don't feel like an ogre assigning homework no I think this is
really good and I think I think it's a lot easier for me to sort of speak to a
journal before I have these kinds of conversations with my family so I love
the organic way in which you've come up with this work if you choose to share it
with me in next sessions I'm very open to that and if you think you still need
to keep it private like it's working for you to keep it private then feel free to
do that as well okay we'll play it by ear okay thanks for coming today yeah
thank you thank you so much I'll see you next week okay

* **Note if therapist made recommendations for higher level of care, means restriction, or other explicit safety measures.**

**Important Constraints:**
* Base the entire note **strictly** on the provided transcript text.
* **Do not infer or add any information** not explicitly present in the transcript.
* ### NEW/MODIFIED ### **CRITICAL:** Do NOT include descriptions of visual appearance (grooming, dress), eye contact, facial expressions (smiles, tears unless noted as sounds), or gestures unless EXPLICITLY stated *in the transcript text*.
* Maintain a **professional, objective, and neutral tone**.
* ### MODIFIED ### If information for a specific section/sub-section is not present in the transcript, clearly state 'Not indicated in transcript' or 'Visuals not available from transcript' as appropriate.
* Do not include any interpretations or diagnoses unless they are directly discussed, strongly evidenced within the transcript, and appropriately qualified (e.g., "consistent with," "potential").
