Clinical Accuracy: Does the note accurately reflect likely details from a standard therapy session without hallucinating facts or 
making unsupported interpretations? Does the tone match what would be expected from an experienced clinician AEB being nonjudgmental, 
objective, and appropriately detailed?
Completeness: Are all requested sections (SOAP, MSE, Risk) present and appropriately addressed based on typical session content?
Clinical Relevance/Salience: Does the note capture clinically significant information vs. conversational filler? Are safety related 
details highlighted in a way that makes them easily accessible to a reviewer?
